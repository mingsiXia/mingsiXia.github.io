title: North Wind

description: In China, there still needs to be more attention to the survival of disadvantaged groups of women. During my time off school, l crossed paths with the lives of three localwomen in my hometown, a small county in Shandong Province. l wanted to use the wind as my main intention and the pain of their lives as the main theme of my work.
